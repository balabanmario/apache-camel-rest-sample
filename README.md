Sample Maven webapp
===================

This is a playground where I test Java / Spring /Apache Camel web development concepts and ideas.
In this project I use xml for Spring and Apache Camel Configuration.

The webapp exposes a GET and a POST method:
http://localhost:8080/rest/sample-api/sample-get/12
and
http://localhost:8080/rest/sample-api/sample-post/

(http://localhost:8080/index.jsp contains simple usage sample)
